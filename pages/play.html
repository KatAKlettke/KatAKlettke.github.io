                <p>I like to worldbuild high concept worlds. Like, what if there were no beasts of burden? How would that change society? (It was no fun, I scratched that and made <em>Yvari</em> a normal fantasy world.)</p>
                <hr>
                <p>What if space and time were malleable and fluid outside of places that are fixed? What if your state of mind affected your travel time and ease? <em>Traveling Magic</em> is my attempt to imagine this. I'm not sure it's a good one, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>What if AIs could have mental health issues as well? I would like to explore that question in a utopian world where humanity is utterly depending on a benevolent AI that suddenly develops shizophrenia. So far, <em>ShizophrenAi</em> is on the backburner because I want to treat the subject with respect and that requires more research than I could invest time in right now.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Finally, like many, I'm fascinated by the "old gods" of Europe. Combine that with Charlemagne and American Gods, two more special interests of mine, and Europe's <em>Dark Ages</em> from the 4th to the 7th century becomes a battlefield of the supernatural. The Christian God versus the Norse Pantheon, with the Christian God winning in the end, culminating in Charlemagne's coronation on christmas day 800 in Aachen </p>

            <div class="section-text">
                <p>Originally, my worldbuilding project Yvari started as a writing project. Worldbuilding for the sake of itself proved too much fun, and so the stories have taken the backseat for now.</p>
                <p>Still, I have stories to tell, if not the skills to do so yet, so thinking about writing is always happening in some corner of my mind. We'll see if and when I will actually start writing again.</p>
                <p>Writing as a craft is still something I'm interested in, and I regularly read books on the craft. In the future, I will gather my thoughts on some of the books I read and possibly post here.</p>

                <p><em>WWWD</em> // <em>Expense Tracking App</em></p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>When Will We Deliver</em> is a small app that helps scrum masters with planning. Using statistical calculations, it asks for the last seven sprint velocities, sprint length, planned story points and then offers you a date by which you most likely will be done.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>With my <em>Expense Tracking App</em> I want to tackle the problem of account statements often being very unintuitive to understand. There's a lot of fintech apps out there trying to help you, but a) I don't want my sensitive data in the hands of people who have an incentive to sell it, and b) hey, why not try to create one for my own use, offline?</p>
