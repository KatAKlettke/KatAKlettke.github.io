                <p>I like to worldbuild high concept worlds. Like, what if there were no beasts of burden? How would that change society? (It was no fun, I scratched that and made it a normal fantasy world.)</p>
                <p>What if space and time were malleable and fluid outside of places that are fixed? What if your state of mind affected your travel time and ease? Traveling Magic is my attempt to imagine this. I'm not sure it's a good one, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.</p>

            <div class="section-text">
                <p>Originally, my worldbuilding project Yvari started as a writing project. Worldbuilding for the sake of itself proved too much fun, and so the stories have taken the backseat for now.</p>
                <p>Still, I have stories to tell, if not the skills to do so yet, so thinking about writing is always happening in some corner of my mind. We'll see if and when I will actually start writing again.</p>
                <p>Writing as a craft is still something I'm interested in, and I regularly read books on the craft. In the future, I will gather my thoughts on some of the books I read and possibly post here.</p>
